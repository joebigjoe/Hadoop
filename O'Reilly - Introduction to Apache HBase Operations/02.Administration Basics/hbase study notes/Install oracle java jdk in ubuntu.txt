Install oracle java jdk in ubuntu

https://medium.com/coderscorner/installing-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-16-10-845507b13343

Step 1: Add Oracleâ€™s PPA(Personal Package Archive) to your list of sources so that Ubuntu knows where to check for the updates. Use add-apt-repository command for that.

if you ubder proxy. use the following command:
export http_proxy="http://web-proxy.corp.hp.com:8080/"
sudo -E add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java

Step 2: Then update your package repository by issuing the following command. apt-get is a command-line tool for handling packages.

sudo apt-get update

Steps 3: Then install Oracle JDK 8 using the following.

sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

when shit happens:
For all users of the system via the /etc/wgetrc or for the user only with the ~/.wgetrc file:
use_proxy=yes
http_proxy=127.0.0.1:8080
https_proxy=127.0.0.1:8080


Step 4: Once it is installed successfully, check for the Java version.

javac -version



Set JAVA_HOME environment variable

    First, find out where Java is installed. You can use the same command as the one we use in step 5 for that.

2. Next open /etc/environment file in any of your favorite editor

sudo nano /etc/environment

3. Add the following line at the end of the file and save it. (Replace the value for JAVA_HOME with the path of your java installation directory)

JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle"

4. Finally reload it and check whether the environment variable has been properly set.

source /etc/environment
echo $JAVA_HOME

when store pig data.
we can use a new PigStorage(':').
in the movie data, the default file is in scv format.
which means it is seperated by comma.
we can change it to other.
store movies INTO 'hdfs:/user/hadoopuser/moviedata/ml-latest-small/notcomma.txt' USING PigStorage(':', '-schema');
this will generate the .pig_schema file, which we can be used in other files.
copy .pig_schema to other fodlers, it will become the default schema for that folder when we load data files.


the result of dump is stored in the temp folders in the HDFS.

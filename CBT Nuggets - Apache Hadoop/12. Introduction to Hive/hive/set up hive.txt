1 download hive from the official site.
	https://hive.apache.org/downloads.html

2 unzip and then save it to /usr/local/hive

3 edit /etc/environment, set the enviroment value $HIVE_HOME=/usr/local/hive, add /usr/local/hive/bin to $PATH

4 $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-env.sh, set HADOOP_HOME="/usr/local/hadoop/hadoop-2.8.5", this may not needed.

5 change the hive-site.xml, under $HIVE_HOME/conf/.
we copy the ones we need to the $HIVE_HOME/conf/.

6 go to /usr/local/hive, and initialize the Schema
	chematool -dbType derby -initSchema

7 run hive

when hadoop is down,
you will see the hive exception.
this means the hive setup is correct.
but the hdfs is not ready.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: java.net.ConnectException: Call From masternode-name/192.168.1.105 to masternode-name:8020 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused; For more details see:  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused

then go to the hdfs:///usr/local/hive/warehouse/movielens.db
this is the loaded DB in HPFS.
usr/local/hive/warehouse is the path in hive-site.xml.
<name>hive.metastore.warehouse.dir</name>
<value>/usr/local/hive/warehouse</value>
only when play with it the hard way.
then we know what is what.

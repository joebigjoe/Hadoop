When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.
“When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives.” 
“What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger.” —Aeron Damphair
“Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.” —Oath of the Night’s Watch[1][2]
